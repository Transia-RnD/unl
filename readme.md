# Unique Node List (UNL)

The XRP Ledger Foundation maintains a Unique Node List (UNL) for the XRPL. This repo is the source for that UNL, published at [https://unl.xrplf.org](https://unl.xrplf.org/).

## Editing the UNL

The process of creating a signed UNL is manual and intentionally non-automated.

To suggest an update to this list, make a Pull Request. If approved, the next build of the UNL will include these changes.
