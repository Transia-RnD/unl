# Unique Node List (UNL)

The XRP Ledger Foundation maintains a Unique Node List (UNL) for the XRPL. This repo is the source for the `UNL`, published at [https://unl.xrplf.org](https://unl.xrplf.org/).

## Editing the UNL

The process of creating a signed UNL is manual and intentionally non-automated.

- To suggest an update to this list, [make a Pull Request](https://github.com/XRPLF/unl/pulls).
- If approved, the next build of the UNL will include these changes.
- Only changes to `data/unl-raw.yaml` are required in your Pull Request.
- Once the PR has been approved, it is manually reviewed by the `XRPLF`.
- The `XRPLF` can then build a new UNL to publish to [https://unl.xrplf.org](https://unl.xrplf.org/).
- For historical purposes we'll create a [release in the unl repo](https://github.com/XRPLF/unl/releases).
